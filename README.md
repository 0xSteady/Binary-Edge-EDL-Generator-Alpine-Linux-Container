# Support Policy

This script is provided under an **as-is, best effort,** support policy. This scripts should be seen as community supported and I will contribute my expertise as and when possible. 

Palo Alto Networks does not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through its normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (Palo Alto Networks NGFW and EDLs) by the scripts is still supported by Palo Alto Networks, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using this script itself.
